# 3D Cloud Scanner - ARM Hackathon 2017

## What is the project about
During the Arm hackathon our team build A wireless server-based 3D scanner with website display using the MBed Cloud Connect Board which was supplied. THe idea is that the user can use the board as a scanner and scan and object and have the 'scan result' (i.e the 3d model of the object) be shown on a Website. 

## How it was created
Apart from the MBed Cloud Environment and IDE a variety of different technologies were used, namely:
* C++ : We used C++ in order to access the board's sensors and have it communicate with the environment
* Python : Was used mainly for the server side of thing, to establish a communication channel between the board and the front-facing website.
* HTML/CSS : HTML5 and CSS3 were used to create a static website through which the user could see the scan result.

## Structure
The folder **/FINAL** contains all the files regarding the final demo packed together for easier access. In contrast the folder **/Temp** contains all the test files regarding the individual components of the project.
